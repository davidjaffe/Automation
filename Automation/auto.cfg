abstact: The Belle II experiment will be at the forefront of indirect searches for non-SM physics using billions of heavy quarks and tau-leptons produced in high-intensity 10 GeV electron-positron collisions from the SuperKEKB collider. The intense beams needed to achieve the required precisions in measurement results are associated with strong beam-background radiation that may damage the inner detectors. A dedicated radiation-monitoring and beam-abort system based on artificial diamond sensors ensures protection and safe data taking conditions. This talk will briefly outline the system and illustrate the operational experience and performance during the 2019 first physics run.

abstact: The Belle II detector, dedicated to investigation of B mesons properties, started data acquisition on SuperKEKB e+e- collider in 2019. Precise measurement of particle momentum in 1.5T magnetic field is crucial for the success of physics program. The measurement of the field inside tracking detector volume was performed in collaboration between CERN, DESY, IFJ PAN and KEK labs. Field itself is complex, as it is a product of combined effect of main analyzing solenoid and system of compensating solenoids. Combination of two robotized measurement campaigns and simulation is used to create final field map for track reconstruction. Mass distribution of known particles is used to assess field map quality.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory.Exploiting the improved collider, Belle II will play an important role in the Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV) field by collecting a huge amount of statistics (50 ab−1 expected by 2028) which allows to probe new physics scenario with best precision. Several LFV measurement can be performed by investigating 𝜏 physics and Belle II, thanks to SuperKEKB, is going to contribute by providing a large 𝜏 sample with ``background free'' environment. This kind of analysis are very promising, in fact also many LHC groups are trying to get new results in this direction. This talk will review the state of the LFV searches at Belle II and it will focus on the analysis strategy of the decay 𝜏→𝜇𝜇𝜇 where a preforming muon identification algorithm is crucial.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB, an asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, has a rich program of Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model physics.The collider, a next generation B factory, started operation in 2016 and successfully commissioned with first collisions in April 2018. In 2019 a first physics run with the full Belle II detector has taken place. Ultimately SuperKEKB will reach a world-record luminosity of 8x1035 cm−2s−1 and aims to record a database of 50 ab−1. In the area of tau physics, this will enable new and/or more precise measurement of Standard Model processes as well as Beyond the Standard Model searches. Because of its well understood electroweak production and decay mechanisms and its high mass of above 1.7 GeV the tau lepton is an excellent probe for physics beyond the standard model, and provides clean samples for studying QCD at the 1 GeV energy level.This contribution will give a compact overview over the tau physics programme at Belle II, with a particular emphasis on first results and decay modes with significant potential in the near future.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. Main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019, with the full detector installed; this first running period ended in July. The machine reached a peak luminosity of 1.2×1034 cm−2s−1, and Belle II recorded a data sample of about 6.5 fb−1. Data taking will resume in October 2019. Already this early data set, with specifically designed triggers, offers the possibility to search for a large variety of dark sector particles in the GeV mass range, complementary to LHC and to dedicated low energy experiments; these searches will benefit from more data which will be accumulated in the upcoming Fall/Winter run. This talk will review the state of the dark sector searches at Belle II with a focus on the discovery potential of the early data, and show the first results

abstract:At the end of 2018 the inner subdetectors, SVD (Silicon Vertex Detector) and PXD (Pixel Detector) were installed in Belle II. By the end of 2019 Belle II has collected a total of 10 fb−1. With the early data taken the charged-particles tracking performance of the detector was characterized, reconstruction of known resonances and the capability of identifying displaced vertices decays. One of the first benchmarks for B physics was the measurement of the B 0 −B mixing frequency. First results are based on the B mesons semileptonic decay mode. The rediscovery of the “golden mode” B0→J/ψK0S, a CP eigenstate, is shown along other B→[cc¯]Xs decay modes.Prospects for dark sector searches, CPV in Charm physics and other motivations for B physics are discussed.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB, an asymmetric e+e- collider, aims at a total integrated luminosity of 50 ab-1, to pursue a rich program of Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model physics. In its first year of operation, approximately 10 fb-1 were collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance, with about 100 fb-1 expected by the end of 2020. This results in a sizeable sample of tau pairs, enabling detailed studies of Standard and Beyond the Standard Model measurements, including searches for Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decays. One of the first channels where competitive limits are expected is the tau -> e + alpha(invisible) process, where alpha is a Goldstone boson. Here, the currently best limit has been obtained by ARGUS with an integrated luminosity of 475 pb-1. Belle II is expected to be able to improve on this result already with the data recorded. This contribution will discuss selected analysis details and present first preliminary results and the prospects for future larger datasets.

abstract:Precision measurements of 𝑉𝑢𝑏 and 𝑉𝑐𝑏 play a central role in precision tests of the CKM sector of the Standard Model and complement direct measurements of CP violation of B meson decays. In this talk, we present first studies for measuring 𝑉𝑢𝑏 and 𝑉𝑐𝑏 with semileptonic decays using collision events recorded at the Υ(4𝑆) resonance by the Belle II experiment. Belle II is located at the SuperKEKB accelerator complex near Tokyo in Japan, and started recording collision data in Spring 2019. We report the status of measuring branching fractions and kinematic properties of inclusive and exclusive 𝑏→𝑐ℓ𝜈¯ℓ and 𝑏→𝑢ℓ𝜈¯ℓ decays using untagged and tagged approaches and the full available Belle II data set.

abstract:The lepton flavour universality predicted by the Standard Model is challenged by various measurements of b-hadron decays involving tau and light leptons. The Belle II experiment started recording first collision data in Spring 2019 and offers a unique laboratory to study lepton flavour universality in leptonic and semileptonic decays of B mesons at high precision. In this talk, we report the status of establishing first measurements of 𝐵→𝜏𝜈¯𝜏, 𝐵→𝜇𝜈¯, and 𝐵→𝐷(∗)𝜏𝜈¯𝜏 processes using the available Belle II data and discuss the future potential of investigating the 𝑅(𝐷(∗)) anomaly.

abstract:The CKM angle 𝛾 is the least well known of the angles of the unitarity triangle and the only one that is accessible with tree-level decays in a theoretically clean way. The key method to measure 𝛾 is through the interference between 𝐵+→𝐷0𝐾+ and 𝐵+→𝐷¯0𝐾+ decays which occurs if the final state of the charm-meson decay is accessible to both the 𝐷0 and 𝐷¯0 mesons. The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. Main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019 and a results from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 will be presented. To achieve the best sensitivity, a large variety of 𝐷 and 𝐵 decay modes is required, which is possible at Belle II experiment as almost any final state can be reconstructed including those with photons. With the ultimate Belle II data sample of 50 ab−1, a determination of 𝛾 with a precision of 1 degree or better is foreseen. This talk will explain the details of the planned measurement at Belle II and include results related to these measurements obtained with the data already collected, including the first studies of the golden mode for 𝜙3 at Belle II: 𝐵+→𝐷(𝐾0S𝜋+𝜋−)𝐾+. The Belle II Experiment started its first Physics Run in Spring 2019 and continued to collect data in 2020. The integrated luminosity collected with the Belle detector including vertex detectors is used to establish the performance of the detector in terms of reconstruction efficiency of final states of interest for the measurement of time-dependent CP violation, both for charm (such as J/psi K(*)0) and charmless (such as eta' K0). We will present the first results based on samples of B mesons that decays to the CP-eigenstates for time dependent analysis, along with a first assessment of the B Flavor Tagging capabilities, together with estimates of the Belle II sensitivity to the CKM angles.

abstract:The physics of charmless B decays is an essential portion of the Belle II program. The expected large yields of charmless B decays will enable significant advancements in the understanding of quark dynamics, including a world-leading determination of the CKM phase alpha/phi_2, a conclusive understanding of the so-called K-pi CP-puzzle, and a deeper insight into phenomenological models of non-perturbative QCD in heavy meson decays. We present preliminary results based on the Belle II sample collected in 2019-2020. First charmless B signals are reconstructed for a variety of two-body and multibody decays. Measurements of their branching fractions and CP-violating asymmetries are used as data-driven benchmarks of current and projected detector and reconstruction performance.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March2019. Belle II has a broad τ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations (LFV and LNV), benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise τ lepton production in e+e− collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on LF and LN violating τ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of LFV or LNV in τ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying New Physics. In this talk we will review the τ lepton physics program of Belle II. Using the Belle II data from the early Phase III data taking, we rediscover the tau leptons using the 3-prong τ decays. This decay mode is used for the tau-lepton mass measurement using the pseudomass technique developed by the ARGUS experiment. Though this measurement is expected to be limited by statistics and imperfect knowledge of the detector performance, we foresee that Belle II will provide the best pseudomass measurement once a larger data set with fully understood and operational detector components is available.

abstract:The Charm sector provides a unique environment for the searches of Physics Beyond the Standard Model. Recent observation of CP violation in the D0 decays by the LHCb collaboration has renewed this interest and calls for confirmation in other channels and by other experiments. As we will discuss in this talk, Belle II will play a crucial role in measuring CP violation in many decay channels, especially those having neutral particles in the final state. We will show the improved reconstruction capabilities of the Belle II detector in charm decays with respect to first generation B-factories using the data collected in 2019 and 2020. Finally, we will show a preliminary result on the measurement of the D0 lifetime, that would be the first at B-Factories, demonstrating the excellent vertexing capabilities of the Belle II detector.

Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. This talk will present recent results in new Belle II data, and future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Early physics goals of the Belle II physics program are to rediscover these rare decays. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already rediscovered with only a small dataset of Belle II and we are aiming to rediscover the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ decays too. Ultimately, the unique setup at Belle II allows to study of modes with missing energies like 𝐵→𝐾∗𝜈𝜈¯. We will discuss about the prospects of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50𝑎𝑏−1 dataset of Belle II.

Calibration studies of the FEI efficiency using standard candle processes such as 𝐵→𝑋ℓ𝜈¯ℓ are reported to evaluate the algorithm’s tagging performance. Further, we discuss the status of future developments to extend the capabilities of the algorithm to reconstruct 𝐵𝑠 mesons and to include baryonic 𝐵 meson decay cascades.

We utilize this dataset to characterize the performance of the detector about tracking of charged particles, reconstruction of known resonances, and capability of identifying displaced decay vertices. In order to assess the B Physics capabilities of the experiment, one of the first benchmarks to be reached consists in the measurement of the lifetime of B mesons and of the B0-B0bar mixing frequency. We present the first results, based on samples of B mesons that decay to hadronic and semi-leptonic final states.

abstract:The Belle II experiment has recently started operations at the SuperKEKB e+e− collider, located at the KEK laboratory in Tsukuba (Japan). The unprecedented luminosity that it plans to collect in the next decade (50 ab−1) will allow Belle II to greatly exceed the precision achieved by the first generation of B- factory experiments (BaBar and Belle), on the physics of B mesons, charmed particles, τ leptons, and exotic states.After summarizing the challenges and the innovative solutions for accelerator and detector, the physics program of the experiment will be broadly presented, with particular emphasis to the areas on which some intriguing anomalies are now appearing. In many of these cases, the input from Belle II will be crucial to confirm or disprove these hints of physics beyond the standard model.In the last part of the presentation, an overview of the physics results obtained with the early datasets will be given. Among these, some searches for Dark Sector particles are already capable of probing new ground, despite the relatively small integrated luminosity collected so far.

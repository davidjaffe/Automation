abstact: The Belle II experiment will be at the forefront of indirect searches for non-SM physics using billions of heavy quarks and tau-leptons produced in high-intensity 10 GeV electron-positron collisions from the SuperKEKB collider. The intense beams needed to achieve the required precisions in measurement results are associated with strong beam-background radiation that may damage the inner detectors. A dedicated radiation-monitoring and beam-abort system based on artificial diamond sensors ensures protection and safe data taking conditions. This talk will briefly outline the system and illustrate the operational experience and performance during the 2019 first physics run.

abstact: The Belle II detector, dedicated to investigation of B mesons properties, started data acquisition on SuperKEKB e+e- collider in 2019. Precise measurement of particle momentum in 1.5T magnetic field is crucial for the success of physics program. The measurement of the field inside tracking detector volume was performed in collaboration between CERN, DESY, IFJ PAN and KEK labs. Field itself is complex, as it is a product of combined effect of main analyzing solenoid and system of compensating solenoids. Combination of two robotized measurement campaigns and simulation is used to create final field map for track reconstruction. Mass distribution of known particles is used to assess field map quality.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory.Exploiting the improved collider, Belle II will play an important role in the Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV) field by collecting a huge amount of statistics (50 ab−1 expected by 2028) which allows to probe new physics scenario with best precision. Several LFV measurement can be performed by investigating 𝜏 physics and Belle II, thanks to SuperKEKB, is going to contribute by providing a large 𝜏 sample with ``background free'' environment. This kind of analysis are very promising, in fact also many LHC groups are trying to get new results in this direction. This talk will review the state of the LFV searches at Belle II and it will focus on the analysis strategy of the decay 𝜏→𝜇𝜇𝜇 where a preforming muon identification algorithm is crucial.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB, an asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, has a rich program of Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model physics.The collider, a next generation B factory, started operation in 2016 and successfully commissioned with first collisions in April 2018. In 2019 a first physics run with the full Belle II detector has taken place. Ultimately SuperKEKB will reach a world-record luminosity of 8x1035 cm−2s−1 and aims to record a database of 50 ab−1. In the area of tau physics, this will enable new and/or more precise measurement of Standard Model processes as well as Beyond the Standard Model searches. Because of its well understood electroweak production and decay mechanisms and its high mass of above 1.7 GeV the tau lepton is an excellent probe for physics beyond the standard model, and provides clean samples for studying QCD at the 1 GeV energy level.This contribution will give a compact overview over the tau physics programme at Belle II, with a particular emphasis on first results and decay modes with significant potential in the near future.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. Main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019, with the full detector installed; this first running period ended in July. The machine reached a peak luminosity of 1.2×1034 cm−2s−1, and Belle II recorded a data sample of about 6.5 fb−1. Data taking will resume in October 2019. Already this early data set, with specifically designed triggers, offers the possibility to search for a large variety of dark sector particles in the GeV mass range, complementary to LHC and to dedicated low energy experiments; these searches will benefit from more data which will be accumulated in the upcoming Fall/Winter run. This talk will review the state of the dark sector searches at Belle II with a focus on the discovery potential of the early data, and show the first results

abstract:At the end of 2018 the inner subdetectors, SVD (Silicon Vertex Detector) and PXD (Pixel Detector) were installed in Belle II. By the end of 2019 Belle II has collected a total of 10 fb−1. With the early data taken the charged-particles tracking performance of the detector was characterized, reconstruction of known resonances and the capability of identifying displaced vertices decays. One of the first benchmarks for B physics was the measurement of the B 0 −B mixing frequency. First results are based on the B mesons semileptonic decay mode. The rediscovery of the “golden mode” B0→J/ψK0S, a CP eigenstate, is shown along other B→[cc¯]Xs decay modes.Prospects for dark sector searches, CPV in Charm physics and other motivations for B physics are discussed.

These early data sets, with specifically designed low multiplicity triggers, offer already the possibility to search for a large variety of dark sector particles in the GeV mass range, complementary to LHC and to dedicated low energy experiments. The talk will review the status of the dark sector searches at Belle II, with a focus on the discovery potential of the early data, and show the first results.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB, an asymmetric e+e- collider, aims at a total integrated luminosity of 50 ab-1, to pursue a rich program of Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model physics. In its first year of operation, approximately 10 fb-1 were collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance, with about 100 fb-1 expected by the end of 2020. This results in a sizeable sample of tau pairs, enabling detailed studies of Standard and Beyond the Standard Model measurements, including searches for Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decays. One of the first channels where competitive limits are expected is the tau -> e + alpha(invisible) process, where alpha is a Goldstone boson. Here, the currently best limit has been obtained by ARGUS with an integrated luminosity of 475 pb-1. Belle II is expected to be able to improve on this result already with the data recorded. This contribution will discuss selected analysis details and present first preliminary results and the prospects for future larger datasets.

abstract:The CKM angle 𝛾 is the least well known of the angles of the unitarity triangle and the only one that is accessible with tree-level decays in a theoretically clean way. The key method to measure 𝛾 is through the interference between 𝐵+→𝐷0𝐾+ and 𝐵+→𝐷¯0𝐾+ decays which occurs if the final state of the charm-meson decay is accessible to both the 𝐷0 and 𝐷¯0 mesons. The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. Main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019 and a results from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 will be presented. To achieve the best sensitivity, a large variety of 𝐷 and 𝐵 decay modes is required, which is possible at Belle II experiment as almost any final state can be reconstructed including those with photons. With the ultimate Belle II data sample of 50 ab−1, a determination of 𝛾 with a precision of 1 degree or better is foreseen. This talk will explain the details of the planned measurement at Belle II and include results related to these measurements obtained with the data already collected, including the first studies of the golden mode for 𝜙3 at Belle II: 𝐵+→𝐷(𝐾0S𝜋+𝜋−)𝐾+. The Belle II Experiment started its first Physics Run in Spring 2019 and continued to collect data in 2020. The integrated luminosity collected with the Belle detector including vertex detectors is used to establish the performance of the detector in terms of reconstruction efficiency of final states of interest for the measurement of time-dependent CP violation, both for charm (such as J/psi K(*)0) and charmless (such as eta' K0). We will present the first results based on samples of B mesons that decays to the CP-eigenstates for time dependent analysis, along with a first assessment of the B Flavor Tagging capabilities, together with estimates of the Belle II sensitivity to the CKM angles.

abstract:The physics of charmless B decays is an essential portion of the Belle II program. The expected large yields of charmless B decays will enable significant advancements in the understanding of quark dynamics, including a world-leading determination of the CKM phase alpha/phi_2, a conclusive understanding of the so-called K-pi CP-puzzle, and a deeper insight into phenomenological models of non-perturbative QCD in heavy meson decays. We present preliminary results based on the Belle II sample collected in 2019-2020. First charmless B signals are reconstructed for a variety of two-body and multibody decays. Measurements of their branching fractions and CP-violating asymmetries are used as data-driven benchmarks of current and projected detector and reconstruction performance.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March2019. Belle II has a broad τ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations (LFV and LNV), benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise τ lepton production in e+e− collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on LF and LN violating τ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of LFV or LNV in τ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying New Physics. In this talk we will review the τ lepton physics program of Belle II. Using the Belle II data from the early Phase III data taking, we rediscover the tau leptons using the 3-prong τ decays. This decay mode is used for the tau-lepton mass measurement using the pseudomass technique developed by the ARGUS experiment. Though this measurement is expected to be limited by statistics and imperfect knowledge of the detector performance, we foresee that Belle II will provide the best pseudomass measurement once a larger data set with fully understood and operational detector components is available.

abstract:The Charm sector provides a unique environment for the searches of Physics Beyond the Standard Model. Recent observation of CP violation in the D0 decays by the LHCb collaboration has renewed this interest and calls for confirmation in other channels and by other experiments. As we will discuss in this talk, Belle II will play a crucial role in measuring CP violation in many decay channels, especially those having neutral particles in the final state. We will show the improved reconstruction capabilities of the Belle II detector in charm decays with respect to first generation B-factories using the data collected in 2019 and 2020. Finally, we will show a preliminary result on the measurement of the D0 lifetime, that would be the first at B-Factories, demonstrating the excellent vertexing capabilities of the Belle II detector.

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Early physics goals of the Belle II physics program are to rediscover these rare decays. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already rediscovered with only a small dataset of Belle II and we are aiming to rediscover the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ decays too. Ultimately, the unique setup at Belle II allows to study of modes with missing energies like 𝐵→𝐾∗𝜈𝜈¯. We will discuss about the prospects of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50𝑎𝑏−1 dataset of Belle II.

We utilize this dataset to characterize the performance of the detector about tracking of charged particles, reconstruction of known resonances, and capability of identifying displaced decay vertices. In order to assess the B Physics capabilities of the experiment, one of the first benchmarks to be reached consists in the measurement of the lifetime of B mesons and of the B0-B0bar mixing frequency. We present the first results, based on samples of B mesons that decay to hadronic and semi-leptonic final states.

abstract:The Belle II experiment has recently started operations at the SuperKEKB e+e− collider, located at the KEK laboratory in Tsukuba (Japan). The unprecedented luminosity that it plans to collect in the next decade (50 ab−1) will allow Belle II to greatly exceed the precision achieved by the first generation of B- factory experiments (BaBar and Belle), on the physics of B mesons, charmed particles, τ leptons, and exotic states.After summarizing the challenges and the innovative solutions for accelerator and detector, the physics program of the experiment will be broadly presented, with particular emphasis to the areas on which some intriguing anomalies are now appearing. In many of these cases, the input from Belle II will be crucial to confirm or disprove these hints of physics beyond the standard model.In the last part of the presentation, an overview of the physics results obtained with the early datasets will be given. Among these, some searches for Dark Sector particles are already capable of probing new ground, despite the relatively small integrated luminosity collected so far.

abstract:The tau-lepton lifetime represents a fundamental parameter within the Standard Model framework, contributing to the test of lepton flavor universality. As the present tau lifetime uncertainty is below 0.2%, a competitive measurement is particularly challenging. The method proposed for the Belle II experiment exploits the tiny beam spot size at the interaction point obtained through the new collision scheme of SuperKEKB. By this method, a competitive statistical uncertainty could already be reached with early Belle II data.

abstract:The physics of charmless $B$ decays is an unique portion of the Belle II program. Expected large signals over moderate backgrounds, associated with efficient reconstruction of neutral particles, will enable world-leading determination of the CKM phase $\alpha/\phi_2$, a conclusive understanding of the so-called K-$\pi$ CP puzzle, and further insight into the nature of localized CP violation in three-body decays. We report preliminary measurements based on the sample collected during 2019-2020 operations and corresponding to 63 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. Results include a test of the $K\pi$ isospin sum-rule, and an angular analysis of $B \to \rho^+ \rho^0$ decays.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric $e^+e^-$ collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range. This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

abstract:A search for the flavour-changing neutral current decay B+ → K+ ν ν is performed with an electron-positron collision data sample corresponding to 63fb−1 collected at the Υ(4S) resonance by the Belle II experiment. A novel measurement method is developed, which exploits topological properties of the decay that differ from both generic bottom-meson decays and light-quark pair-production. This inclusive tagging approach has the benefit of a higher signal efficiency compared to previous searches for this rare decay. As no significant signal is observed, an upper limit on the branching fraction of B+ → K+ ν ν of 4.4 × 10−5 is set at the 90% confidence level.

The experiment began operation in 2019 and aims to record a factor of 50 times more data than its predecessor. Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. We present recent results in new Belle II data, and the future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×10^{35} cm^{−2}s^{−1} and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab^{−1} of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II. In this presentation, we will review the status of the Belle II detector, the results of the planned measurements with the full available Belle II data set, and the prospects for physics at Belle II.

abstract:The study of lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in semitauonic 𝑏-hadron decays has become increasingly important in light of longstanding anomalies in their measured branching fractions, and the very large datasets anticipated from the LHC and Belle II. Belle II is a next-generation SuperB-Factory and successfully started its physics run in 2019. It is expected that Belle II will collect a first sizeable data set in 2021. In this talk, I review the expected sensitivity of semitauonic and other relevant auxiliary measurements to probe LFUV at Belle II. Furthermore, I will discuss how property measurements using full differential information will be obtained in the future in an unbiased way, and how such information can be combined with similar measurements from LHCb and across multiple channels.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is an upgrade of the B factory facility at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. The experiment began operation in 2019 and aims to record a factor of 50 times more data than its predecessor. Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. We present recent results in new Belle II data, and the future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

abstract:sin2𝜙1 (sin2𝛽) is measured using the 𝐶𝑃-eigenstates induced by the 𝑏→𝑐 tree diagram and it is the most precise variable among the CKM angles. We have presented the result of the measurement using the 𝐵0→𝐽/𝜓𝐾0𝑆 decay collected from the early Belle II data. On the other hand, it can be measured also using the decays induced by 𝑏→𝑠 penguin diagram. In that case, contribution of the new physics is expected so that effective sin2𝜙1≡sin2𝜙eff1 is measured. In relation to those measurements, we present the re-discoveries of the 𝐵0→𝐽/𝜓𝐾0𝐿 and 𝐵0→𝜂′𝐾0𝑆 decays using the data set obtained by the Belle II in 2019 and 2020. Former one is a good indicator to check the difference of 𝐶𝑃 eigenvalue between 𝐵0→𝐽/𝜓𝐾0𝑆. Latter one is one of the modes used for sin2𝜙eff1 measurement and its branching fraction is relatively large.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019. Belle II has a broad τ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations (LFV and LNV), benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise τ lepton production in e+e− collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on LF and LN violating τ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of LFV or LNV in τ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying New Physics. In this talk we will review the τ lepton physics program of Belle II.

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles.The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Early physics goals of the Belle II physics program are to rediscover these rare decays. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already rediscovered with only a small dataset of Belle II and we are aiming to rediscover the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ decays too. We will discuss about the prospects of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50𝑎𝑏−1 dataset of Belle II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb−1 of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range. This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric e+e− collider, SuperKEKB, aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the next decade, a factor of 50 more than Belle. During the first 1.5 years of operations, around 90 fb−1 of data were collected. This dataset is used to measure the lifetimes of a few charm hadrons, confirming the expected performance of the Belle II detector, in particular the vertexing, which plays a crucial role in time dependent measurements. Thanks to the performance of the detector and the amount of data that we expect to collect, Belle II will play a crucial role in measuring CP violation and D0−D¯0 mixing in many decay channels, especially those having neutral particles in the final state. In this presentation we will also show the sensitivity on mixing and CPV parameters in the golden channel D0→KSπ+π− with a time-dependent Dalitz analysis, and other channels.

abstract:The Belle II experiment has accumulated data corresponding to 89.99 fb-1 integrated luminosity in the past 2 years, and is performing very good. Waiting that the full planned data set will be recorded (50 ab-1), which will allow search for rare processes and will have a tremendous impact in the spectroscopy field, the Phase 3 data set allows to already perform analysis with high precision. We present here the analysis of B -> K J/psi pi pi and B -> K psi(2S): in the former for the first time the evidence for the X(3872) --->Jpsi pi pi has been found at Belle II, which is consistent with the observation at Belle of the same resonant state, performed in 2003. The re-discovery of the X(3872) based on the early Phase3 data includes the efficiency and resolution study, calibration with B -> K psi(2S), and background check. When higher statistics will be available, Belle II is planning the even more interesting analysis of B--->DD*K, and search for X(3872)→DD*.

abstract:Belle II is a B-Factory experiment designed to produce precision measurements of CP violation in the weak sector as well as search for Beyond the Standard Model particle physics. The 𝑒+𝑒− collisions are created by the SuperKEKB accelerator which has achieved a world record of instantaneous luminosity of 2.4×1034cm−2s−1. One of the highest priorities for the early data of the experiment is the search for dark photons that decay to dark matter. A dark photon is a mediator within the dark sector which mixes with the Standard Model (SM) photon. The experimental signature is a single energetic photon observed in the detector. A dark photon would produce an excess of events in the single photon recoil mass. A particularly challenging case is when the visible photon carries the full beam energy, which corresponds to a low-mass dark photon. There is a significant background from the SM process 𝑒+𝑒−→𝛾𝛾, where one of the photons is missed due to detector imperfections. This has motivated us to study the structure of the sub-detectors and compare the data and Monte Carlo response. By understanding the photon detection sensitivity of the sub-detectors, we will estimate the background for dark photon studies. This talk will discuss the ''single photon search'' and the approach to quantifying this background.

abstract:The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is currently the best known description of the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. However, among other things, it cannot explain the existence of dark matter, and some experimental results deviate from SM predicitons, suggesting the possibility of including New Physics by extending the SM. Possible extensions are known as dark sector, and the 𝐿𝜇−𝐿𝜏 model, introducing a 𝑍′ dark boson with 𝑀≈(MeV-GeV), is particularly interesting. In this presentation, the analysis strategy and the preliminary results obtained on Monte Carlo for the search for the visible decay of a 𝑍′ with the Belle II detector in the process 𝑒+𝑒−→𝜇+𝜇−𝑍′, 𝑍′→𝜏+𝜏− will be presented. The Belle II experiment, located at the asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb−1 of data were collected.

abstract:Charmless 𝐵 decays provide a unique portion of the Belle II program. The expected large signal yields with moderate backgrounds associated with efficient reconstruction of neutral particles enable world-leading determination of the CKM phase 𝛼/𝜙2, a conclusive understanding of the so-called K-𝜋 CP puzzle, and further insight into the nature of localized CP violation in three-body decays. We report preliminary measurements based on the sample collected during 2019-2020 operations and corresponding to 65 fb−1 of integrated luminosity. Results include a test of the 𝐾𝜋 isospin sum-rule, an angular analysis of 𝐵→𝜌+𝜌0 decays, and the reconstruction of a 𝐵0→𝜋0𝜋0 signal.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric $e^+e^-$ collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range. This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Early physics goals of the Belle II physics program are to rediscover these rare decays. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already rediscovered with only a small dataset of Belle II and we are aiming to rediscover the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ decays too. We present the first search for 𝐵→𝐾𝜈𝜈¯ at Belle II. We will discuss about the prospects of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50 𝑎𝑏−1 dataset of Belle II.

The Belle II detector benefits from a larger tracking detector and improved tracking and vertexing algorithms with respect to Belle, allowing for improvements in the reconstruction of vertices that are displaced from the interaction point. This talk will review the prospects for long-lived particle searches at Belle II.

abstract:Precision determinations of 𝑉𝑢𝑏 and 𝑉𝑐𝑏 play a central role in precision tests of the CKM sector of the Standard Model and complement direct measurements of CP violation of B meson decays. In this talk, we present first studies towards measurements of |𝑉𝑢𝑏| and 𝑉𝑐𝑏, with semileptonic decays using collision events recorded at the Υ(4𝑆) resonance by the Belle II experiment. We report the status of measuring branching fractions and kinematic properties of inclusive and exclusive 𝑏→𝑢ℓ𝜈¯ℓ and 𝑏→𝑐ℓ𝜈¯ℓ decays using untagged and tagged approaches in the full available Belle II data set. In addition, we present a Belle II measurement of the 𝑞2 moments of 𝐵→𝑋𝑐ℓ𝜈 decay. The 𝑞2 moments of the 𝑏→𝑐ℓ𝜈 transition are particularly powerful for constraining the Heavy Quark Expansion as they can be expressed in terms of a reduced set of matrix elements due to reparametrization invariance.

author:Benedikt Wach
abstract:The CKM angle 𝛾 (𝜙3) of the unitarity triangle is the only one that is accessible with tree-level decays in a theoretically clean way. The key method to measure 𝛾 is through the interference between 𝐵+→𝐷0𝐾+ and 𝐵+→𝐷¯0𝐾+ decays that occurs if the final state of the charm-meson decay is accessible to both the 𝐷0 and 𝐷¯0 mesons. The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With the ultimate Belle II data sample of 50 ab−1, a determination of 𝛾 with a precision of 1 degree or better is foreseen. Main operation of SuperKEKB started in March 2019 and results from the full available Belle II data set, which corresponds to approximately 100~fb−1, will be presented. The ratios of decay rates of Γ(𝐵−→𝐷(∗)0𝐾−)/Γ(𝐵−→𝐷(∗)0𝜋−) and Γ(𝐵¯0→𝐷(∗)+𝐾−)/Γ(𝐵¯0→𝐷(∗)+𝜋−) are measured. In addition, more detailed studies of 𝐵−→𝐷(𝐾0S𝜋+𝜋−)𝐾−, 𝐵−→𝐷(𝐾0S𝜋0)𝐾− and 𝐵−→𝐷∗0(𝐷0𝜋0)𝐾− decays are described; these modes are key to the accurate determination of 𝛾 at Belle II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, SuperKEKB, aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the next decade, a factor of 50 more than Belle. During the first 1.5 years of operations, around 90 fb−1 of data were collected. This dataset is used to measure the lifetimes of a few charm hadrons, confirming the expected performance of the Belle II detector, in particular the vertexing, which plays a crucial role in time dependent measurements. Thanks to the performance of the detector and the amount of data that we expect to collect, Belle II will play a crucial role in measuring 𝐶𝑃 violation and 𝐷0−𝐷¯0 mixing in many decay channels, especially those having neutral particles in the final state. In this presentation we will also show the sensitivity on mixing and CPV parameters in the golden channel 𝐷0→𝐾𝑆𝜋+𝜋− with a time-dependent Dalitz analysis, and other channels.

Waiting that the full planned data set will be recorded (50 ab-1), which will allow search for rare processes and will have a tremendous impact in the spectroscopy field, the Phase 3 data set allows to already perform analysis with high precision. We present here the analysis of B -> K J/psi pi pi and B -> K psi(2S): in the former for the first time the evidence for the X(3872) --->Jpsi pi pi has been found at Belle II, which is consistent with the observation at Belle of the same resonant state, performed in 2003.The re-discovery of the X(3872) based on the early Phase3 data includes the efficiency and resolution study, calibration with B -> K psi(2S), and background check. When higher statistics will be available, Belle II is planning the even more interesting analysis of B--->DDK, and search for X(3872)→DD

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC), i.e. 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ transitions, hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.A search for the flavor-changing neutral current decay 𝐵+→𝐾+𝜈𝜈¯ is performed with data sample corresponding to 63 𝑓𝑏−1 collected at the Υ(4S) resonance by the Belle II experiment. A novel measurement method is developed, which exploits topological properties of the decay that differ from both generic B-meson decays and light-quark pair-production. This inclusive tagging approach has the benefit of a higher signal efficiency compared to previous searches for this rare decay. As no significant signal is observed, an upper limit on the branching fraction of 𝐵+→𝐾+𝜈𝜈¯ = 4.1×10−5 is set at the 90% confidence level. We will talk about this novel analysis technique and the result.

The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March2019. Belle II has a broad τ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations (LFV and LNV), benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise τ lepton production in e+e− collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on LF and LN violating τ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of LFV or LNV in τ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying New Physics. In this talk we will review the τ lepton physics program of Belle II.

The Belle II experiment has recorded data corresponding to 89.99 fb-1 integrated luminosity, with which we have performed the analysis of the e+e- -> psi(2S), psi(2S)-> pi+ pi- Jpsi, pi0 pi0 Jpsi, and eta Jpsi.

abstract:The Belle II experiment has accumulated data corresponding to 89.99 fb-1 integrated luminosity in the past 2 years, and is performing very well. We present here the analysis of B -> K J/psi pi pi and B -> K psi(2S): in the former for the first time the evidence for the X(3872) --->Jpsi pi pi has been found at Belle II, which is consistent with the observation at Belle of the same resonant state.

author:Bianca Savino
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB e+e− collider plans to collect 50 times as much data as the previous generation of experiments. Belle II offers unique capabilities to use the bottomonium system (pairs of bottom/anti-bottom quarks) as a pathway to study new particles and physics beyond the Standard Model. We present the potential for studying exotic multi-quark states, and searching lepton flavor violation and decays to new particles, related to bottomonium at Belle II.

author:Filippo Dattola
abstract:This contribution illustrates a new search for the flavor-changing neutral-current decay B+→K+νν performed by the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider. In this study, a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 63 fb-1 collected at the Υ(4S) resonance and an additional sample of 9 fb-1 collected at an energy 60 MeV below the resonance are used. A novel technique, based on an inclusive tagging method and exploiting the topological features of the B+→K+νν decay, is employed and it provides a higher signal efficiency with respect to the methods used in the previous searches. Future prospects and extensions of the inclusive tagging are also illustrated.

abstract:The Belle~II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric $e^+e^-$-collider. The design luminosity of the machine is $8~\times~10^{35}~\text{cm}^{2}\text{s}^{-1}$ and the Belle~II experiment aims to record $50~\text{ab}^{-1}$ of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019. Belle II has a broad $\tau$ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations, benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise $\tau$ lepton production in $e^+e^-$ -collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on lepton flavour and lepton number violating $\tau$ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of lepton flavour or lepton number violations in $\tau$ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying new physics. We also present a first measurement of the $\tau$-mass and the prospects for the $\tau$-lifetime measurement. In this talk we will review the $\tau$ lepton physics program of Belle~II.

Belle II aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb−1 of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range. This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

title:Results and Prospects for Radiative and Electroweak Penguin Decays at Belle II
author:Yo Sato
abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level or box diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already been observed and inclusive photon spectra is also obtained with only a small dataset of Belle II. Early measurements related to the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ and 𝑏→𝑠𝜈𝜈¯ decays has also been performed. We will discuss the results obtained with the current dataset along with the prospects for the searches of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50 𝑎𝑏−1 full dataset of Belle II.

title:Belle II: status and prospects
author:Paolo Branchini
abstract:Belle II at the electron-positron collider SuperKEKB is the successor to the Belle experiment. Its design luminosity is 6 · 1035/(cm2s), 40 times the record achieved at KEKB/Belle, at the same center of mass energy in the bottomonium region. Over the next years it is expected to accumulate an integrated luminosity of 50 ab−1, collecting by far the largest sample of B-mesons at electron-positron colliders, together with large numbers of bottomonium and lighter particles. After a commissioning run in 2018 the detector started routine data taking in March 2019. we have collected more than 200 fb-1 statistics so far. In this talk the current status of the detector, current and future running conditions a selection of the present physics results and further physics prospects will be shown.

title:Dark sector physics at Belle II
author:Giacomo De Pietro
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb−1 of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range.This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

The target luminosity of the machine is 6×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II. In this presentation, we will review the status of the Belle II detector, the results of the planned measurements with the full available Belle II data set, and the prospects for physics at Belle II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector, operating at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 10^35 cm−2s−1, and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and the main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019. Belle II has a broad tau physics program, from high-precision measurements of SM parameters to searches of new physics via experimental observation of BSM processes, such as lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation or lepton flavor violation (LFV) decays. In this talk we review the status of the Belle II experiment, and the prospects for the measurement of the tau lepton mass and lifetime, fundamental inputs in tests of LFU violation.

author:Chaoyi Lyu
abstract:Semileptonic B decays allow measurements of the magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements V_cb and V_ub, thus providing access to fundamental parameters of the theory. Thanks to the low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event, Belle II is expected to greatly improve the precision on these parameters, using both inclusive and exclusive techniques. The latest results and prospects will be presented. In addition, measurements of the CKM unitarity triangle angles, which parameterize CP violation in the standard model, will be discussed.

title:Quarkonium at Belle II
author:Junhao Yin
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider is an upgrade of the B factory facility at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. The experiment began operation in 2019 and aims to record a factor of 50 times more data than its predecessor. Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. We present recent results in new Belle II data, and the future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

author:Kojima Kazuki
abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of B-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. In addition there are discrepancies with the SM predictions in 𝑏→𝑐𝜏𝜈 decays. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. The present status of measurements at Belle II related to these so called B anomalies will be presented, including a novel search for the 𝐵→𝐾𝜈𝜈¯, 𝑏→𝑠 transition.

title:The Belle II: status and prospects
author:Eiasha Waheed
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The target luminosity of the machine is 6×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II. In this presentation, we will review the status of the Belle II detector, the results of the planned measurements with the full available Belle II data set, and the prospects for physics at Belle II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is in the unique position of probing a yet uncharted sector of particle physics, which includes hypothetical particles coupling very weekly with the standard model ones that might help explaining the nature of dark matter and other anomalies. Belle II analyzed 0.5 fb-1 of commissioning data to exclude part of the parameter space of models including low mass Z` bosons and axion-like particles. The results of a new search for Dark-Higgstrahlung processes, obtained on the 2019 data set, are presented and longer-term reach on a variety of Dark Sector signatures are also discussed.

author:Zuzana Gruberova
abstract:The low-background environment of electron-positron collisions along with the large expected sample size and an hermetic detector make Belle II the premier experiment for studying tau-lepton physics. A competitive measurement of the mass of the tau lepton is reported based on a a small data set, and studies for world-leading measurements of tau lifetimes, foreseen with significantly less data than collected at Belle and Babar, are discussed. Perspectives on tests of lepton (flavor) universality and other searches for non-SM physics in tau decays are also outlined.

title:Prospects of the new physics search at Belle II by precise measurements of the CKM matrix elements
author:Yun-Tsung Lai
abstract:In Standard Model, CKM matrix describes the quark coupling strength with weak interaction, as the determination on the elements is always an important field in flavor physics. Deviation from the unitarity of the matrix can be an indication to physics beyond the Standard Model. Measurements on various B decay mechanisms provide experimental constraints on each of the matrix elements, as some of them are unique to B factories. Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB has started beam collision since 2018. It is designed to reach an expected instantaneous luminosity of 6*10^35 cm^-2s^-1 and a integrated luminosity of ~50 ab^-1. Measurement in Belle II benefits not only from the larger amount of data but also the better performance in both detectors and software packages. e.g. tracking, vertexing, PID, reconstruction, etc, as they will improve the determination on CKM matrix elements in various aspects. This talk will review on status of measurements associated to each element, the possible improvement on the sensitivity and the prospect in Belle II.

title:Prospects of |Vub| measurement at Belle II
author:Tommy Martinov
abstract:Belle II is a B-factory experiment and thus offers a perfect environment for measuring the CKM-matrix element |Vub|. This measurement is particularly important for a precise test of the unitarity condition. Two types of measurement exist to extract |Vub|, both relying on semi-leptonic decays of B mesons: the exclusive measurements (where a particular u-hadron is reconstructed) and the inclusive measurements (they effectively sum over all possible hadronic final states containing a u-quark). The two methods show a long-standing discrepancy of 3sigma. I will present in this talk the first studies of |Vub| performed at Belle II and I will outline what the prospects are for this measurement.

With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with 𝐵 and charmed mesons, and 𝜏 leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II.

abstract:The investigation of B-meson decays to charmed and charmless hadronic final states is a keystone of the Belle II physics program. It allows for theoretically reliable and experimentally precise constraints on the CKM Unitarity Triangle fit, and is sensitive to effects from non-SM physics. Results on branching ratios, direct CP-violating asymmetries, and polarization of various charmless B decays are presented, with particular emphasis on those for which Belle II will have unique sensitivity. Perspectives on the precision achievable on the CKM angles and on the so called 'Kπ puzzle' are also discussed.New results from combined analyses of Belle and Belle II data to determine the CKM angle ϕ3 (or γ) and time-dependent CP violation measurements are also presented.

author:Christoph Schwanda
abstract:The rate of semitauonic B decays has been consistently above theory expectations since these decays were first measured. Recently significant differences between the forward-backward asymmetry in B -> Denu and B -> Dmunu were also reported. Belle II data are well suited to probe these anomalies. The low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event offer high precision. This talk presents recent Belle II results on lepton flavor universality tests based on B->D(*)ell nu decays. We also discuss anomalies in hadronic B decay such as the 𝐾𝜋 puzzle and the 𝑏→𝐷(∗)ℎ branching fractions.

title:Recent Belle II results on semitauonic decays and tests of lepton-flavor universality
author:Henrik Junkerkalefeld
abstract:The rate of semitauonic 𝐵 decays has been consistently above theory expectations since these decays were first measured. Recently significant differences between the forward-backward asymmetry in 𝐵→𝐷∗𝑒𝜈 and 𝐵→𝐷∗𝜇𝜈 were also reported. Belle II data is well suited to probe such anomalies. The low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event offer high precision measurements of semileptonic 𝐵 decays. This talk presents recent Belle II results on lepton flavor universality tests based on inclusive decays.

title:Recent Belle II results on hadronic B decays
author:Justin Skorupa
abstract:The investigation of 𝐵-meson decays to charmed and charmless hadronic final states is a keystone of the Belle II physics program. It allows for theoretically reliable and experimentally precise constraints on the CKM Unitarity Triangle fit, and is sensitive to effects from non-SM physics. Results on branching ratios, direct CP-violating asymmetries, and polarization of various charmless B decays are presented, with particular emphasis on those for which Belle II will have unique sensitivity. New results from combined analyses of Belle and Belle II data to determine the CKM angle 𝜙3 (or 𝛾) are also presented. Perspectives on the precision achievable on the CKM angles and on the so called `𝐾𝜋 puzzle` are also discussed.

title:Recent tau-lepton results at Belle II
author:Francesco Tenchini
abstract:The low-background environment of electron-positron collisions along with the large expected sample size and an hermetic detector make Belle II the premier experiment for studying tau-lepton physics. This talk presents recent world-leading physics results from Belle II searches for tau decays into a scalar non-SM particle and a lepton. Perspectives on tests of lepton (flavor) universality and other searches for non-SM physics in tau decays are also outlined.

title:Recent Belle II results on electroweak penguins
author:Eldar Ganiev
abstract:Decays of B mesons that proceed through electroweak penguin amplitudes attract significant attention due to a number of observed discrepancies between the standard-model predictions and the results. Belle II is expected to perform measurements on channels closely related to those exhibiting anomalies and that are uniquely available to Belle II. These include b→s(d)νν¯ and b→s(d)τ+τ− transitions. We present recent results on b→sℓ+ℓ− and b→sνν¯ transitions. In addition we show results related to radiative penguin transitions b->s gamma and b->d gamma.

title:Recent Belle II results on decay-time-dependent CP violation
author:Chiara La Licata
abstract:Measurements of decay-time dependent CP violation are chief goals of the Belle II physics program. Comparison between penguin-dominated 𝑏→𝑞𝑞¯𝑠 and tree-dominated 𝑏→𝑐𝑐¯𝑠 results allows for stringent tests of CKM unitarity that are sensitive to non-SM physics. This talk present first Belle II results on the mixing rate and lifetime of 𝐵0 mesons, an essential validation of time-dependent measurements that requires detailed control of complex high-level capabilities such as flavor tagging and decay-time resolution modeling. Recent results on 𝐵0→𝐾0𝑆𝜋0𝛾 and 𝐵0→𝐾0𝑆𝐾0𝑆𝐾0𝑆 are also reported.

author:Taichiro Koga
abstract:Semileptonic 𝐵 decays allow to determine the magnitudes of the CKM matrix parameters |𝑉𝑐𝑏| and |𝑉𝑢𝑏|, two fundamental parameters of the standard model flavor sector. At Belle II these measurements use both exclusive decays such as 𝐵→𝐷∗ℓ𝜈 and 𝐵→𝜋ℓ𝜈, or inclusive 𝑋𝑐ℓ𝜈 or 𝑋𝑢ℓ𝜈 final states restricted in phase space. The low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two 𝐵 mesons in the event offer high precision. Recent results on |𝑉𝑐𝑏| and |𝑉𝑢𝑏|, along with a novel measurement of lepton-𝑞2 moments are presented, along with future perspectives.

title:Recent results at Belle II
author:Valerio Bertacchi
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e- collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 6×10^35 cm-2s-1 and the Belle II experiment aims to ultimately record 50 ab-1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. In this presentation, we will review the latest results from Belle II.

abstact: The Belle II experiment will be at the forefront of indirect searches for non-SM physics using billions of heavy quarks and tau-leptons produced in high-intensity 10 GeV electron-positron collisions from the SuperKEKB collider. The intense beams needed to achieve the required precisions in measurement results are associated with strong beam-background radiation that may damage the inner detectors. A dedicated radiation-monitoring and beam-abort system based on artificial diamond sensors ensures protection and safe data taking conditions. This talk will briefly outline the system and illustrate the operational experience and performance during the 2019 first physics run.

abstact: The Belle II detector, dedicated to investigation of B mesons properties, started data acquisition on SuperKEKB e+e- collider in 2019. Precise measurement of particle momentum in 1.5T magnetic field is crucial for the success of physics program. The measurement of the field inside tracking detector volume was performed in collaboration between CERN, DESY, IFJ PAN and KEK labs. Field itself is complex, as it is a product of combined effect of main analyzing solenoid and system of compensating solenoids. Combination of two robotized measurement campaigns and simulation is used to create final field map for track reconstruction. Mass distribution of known particles is used to assess field map quality.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory.Exploiting the improved collider, Belle II will play an important role in the Lepton Flavour Violation (LFV) field by collecting a huge amount of statistics (50 ab−1 expected by 2028) which allows to probe new physics scenario with best precision. Several LFV measurement can be performed by investigating 𝜏 physics and Belle II, thanks to SuperKEKB, is going to contribute by providing a large 𝜏 sample with ``background free'' environment. This kind of analysis are very promising, in fact also many LHC groups are trying to get new results in this direction. This talk will review the state of the LFV searches at Belle II and it will focus on the analysis strategy of the decay 𝜏→𝜇𝜇𝜇 where a preforming muon identification algorithm is crucial.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB, an asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, has a rich program of Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model physics.The collider, a next generation B factory, started operation in 2016 and successfully commissioned with first collisions in April 2018. In 2019 a first physics run with the full Belle II detector has taken place. Ultimately SuperKEKB will reach a world-record luminosity of 8x1035 cm−2s−1 and aims to record a database of 50 ab−1. In the area of tau physics, this will enable new and/or more precise measurement of Standard Model processes as well as Beyond the Standard Model searches. Because of its well understood electroweak production and decay mechanisms and its high mass of above 1.7 GeV the tau lepton is an excellent probe for physics beyond the standard model, and provides clean samples for studying QCD at the 1 GeV energy level.This contribution will give a compact overview over the tau physics programme at Belle II, with a particular emphasis on first results and decay modes with significant potential in the near future.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. Main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019, with the full detector installed; this first running period ended in July. The machine reached a peak luminosity of 1.2×1034 cm−2s−1, and Belle II recorded a data sample of about 6.5 fb−1. Data taking will resume in October 2019. Already this early data set, with specifically designed triggers, offers the possibility to search for a large variety of dark sector particles in the GeV mass range, complementary to LHC and to dedicated low energy experiments; these searches will benefit from more data which will be accumulated in the upcoming Fall/Winter run. This talk will review the state of the dark sector searches at Belle II with a focus on the discovery potential of the early data, and show the first results

abstract:At the end of 2018 the inner subdetectors, SVD (Silicon Vertex Detector) and PXD (Pixel Detector) were installed in Belle II. By the end of 2019 Belle II has collected a total of 10 fb−1. With the early data taken the charged-particles tracking performance of the detector was characterized, reconstruction of known resonances and the capability of identifying displaced vertices decays. One of the first benchmarks for B physics was the measurement of the B 0 −B mixing frequency. First results are based on the B mesons semileptonic decay mode. The rediscovery of the “golden mode” B0→J/ψK0S, a CP eigenstate, is shown along other B→[cc¯]Xs decay modes.Prospects for dark sector searches, CPV in Charm physics and other motivations for B physics are discussed.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric $e^+ e^-$ collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is $8\times 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. During 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run, recording a data sample of about 0.5 fb$^{-1}$. Main operations started in March 2019 with the complete Belle II detector: an integrated luminosity of ~60 fb$^{-1}$ has been collected so far. These early data sets, with specifically designed low multiplicity triggers, offer already the possibility to search for a large variety of dark sector particles in the GeV mass range, complementary to LHC and to dedicated low energy experiments. The talk will review the status of the dark sector searches at Belle II, with a focus on the discovery potential of the early data, and show the first results.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB, an asymmetric e+e- collider, aims at a total integrated luminosity of 50 ab-1, to pursue a rich program of Standard Model and Beyond the Standard Model physics. In its first year of operation, approximately 10 fb-1 were collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance, with about 100 fb-1 expected by the end of 2020. This results in a sizeable sample of tau pairs, enabling detailed studies of Standard and Beyond the Standard Model measurements, including searches for Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decays. One of the first channels where competitive limits are expected is the tau -> e + alpha(invisible) process, where alpha is a Goldstone boson. Here, the currently best limit has been obtained by ARGUS with an integrated luminosity of 475 pb-1. Belle II is expected to be able to improve on this result already with the data recorded. This contribution will discuss selected analysis details and present first preliminary results and the prospects for future larger datasets.

abstract:Precision measurements of 𝑉𝑢𝑏 and 𝑉𝑐𝑏 play a central role in precision tests of the CKM sector of the Standard Model and complement direct measurements of CP violation of B meson decays. In this talk, we present first studies for measuring 𝑉𝑢𝑏 and 𝑉𝑐𝑏 with semileptonic decays using collision events recorded at the Υ(4𝑆) resonance by the Belle II experiment. Belle II is located at the SuperKEKB accelerator complex near Tokyo in Japan, and started recording collision data in Spring 2019. We report the status of measuring branching fractions and kinematic properties of inclusive and exclusive 𝑏→𝑐ℓ𝜈¯ℓ and 𝑏→𝑢ℓ𝜈¯ℓ decays using untagged and tagged approaches and the full available Belle II data set.

abstract:The lepton flavour universality predicted by the Standard Model is challenged by various measurements of b-hadron decays involving tau and light leptons. The Belle II experiment started recording first collision data in Spring 2019 and offers a unique laboratory to study lepton flavour universality in leptonic and semileptonic decays of B mesons at high precision. In this talk, we report the status of establishing first measurements of 𝐵→𝜏𝜈¯𝜏, 𝐵→𝜇𝜈¯, and 𝐵→𝐷(∗)𝜏𝜈¯𝜏 processes using the available Belle II data and discuss the future potential of investigating the 𝑅(𝐷(∗)) anomaly.

abstract:The CKM angle 𝛾 is the least well known of the angles of the unitarity triangle and the only one that is accessible with tree-level decays in a theoretically clean way. The key method to measure 𝛾 is through the interference between 𝐵+→𝐷0𝐾+ and 𝐵+→𝐷¯0𝐾+ decays which occurs if the final state of the charm-meson decay is accessible to both the 𝐷0 and 𝐷¯0 mesons. The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. Main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019 and a results from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 will be presented. To achieve the best sensitivity, a large variety of 𝐷 and 𝐵 decay modes is required, which is possible at Belle II experiment as almost any final state can be reconstructed including those with photons. With the ultimate Belle II data sample of 50 ab−1, a determination of 𝛾 with a precision of 1 degree or better is foreseen. This talk will explain the details of the planned measurement at Belle II and include results related to these measurements obtained with the data already collected, including the first studies of the golden mode for 𝜙3 at Belle II: 𝐵+→𝐷(𝐾0S𝜋+𝜋−)𝐾+. The Belle II Experiment started its first Physics Run in Spring 2019 and continued to collect data in 2020. The integrated luminosity collected with the Belle detector including vertex detectors is used to establish the performance of the detector in terms of reconstruction efficiency of final states of interest for the measurement of time-dependent CP violation, both for charm (such as J/psi K(*)0) and charmless (such as eta' K0). We will present the first results based on samples of B mesons that decays to the CP-eigenstates for time dependent analysis, along with a first assessment of the B Flavor Tagging capabilities, together with estimates of the Belle II sensitivity to the CKM angles.

abstract:The physics of charmless B decays is an essential portion of the Belle II program. The expected large yields of charmless B decays will enable significant advancements in the understanding of quark dynamics, including a world-leading determination of the CKM phase alpha/phi_2, a conclusive understanding of the so-called K-pi CP-puzzle, and a deeper insight into phenomenological models of non-perturbative QCD in heavy meson decays. We present preliminary results based on the Belle II sample collected in 2019-2020. First charmless B signals are reconstructed for a variety of two-body and multibody decays. Measurements of their branching fractions and CP-violating asymmetries are used as data-driven benchmarks of current and projected detector and reconstruction performance.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March2019. Belle II has a broad τ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations (LFV and LNV), benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise τ lepton production in e+e− collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on LF and LN violating τ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of LFV or LNV in τ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying New Physics. In this talk we will review the τ lepton physics program of Belle II. Using the Belle II data from the early Phase III data taking, we rediscover the tau leptons using the 3-prong τ decays. This decay mode is used for the tau-lepton mass measurement using the pseudomass technique developed by the ARGUS experiment. Though this measurement is expected to be limited by statistics and imperfect knowledge of the detector performance, we foresee that Belle II will provide the best pseudomass measurement once a larger data set with fully understood and operational detector components is available.

abstract:The Charm sector provides a unique environment for the searches of Physics Beyond the Standard Model. Recent observation of CP violation in the D0 decays by the LHCb collaboration has renewed this interest and calls for confirmation in other channels and by other experiments. As we will discuss in this talk, Belle II will play a crucial role in measuring CP violation in many decay channels, especially those having neutral particles in the final state. We will show the improved reconstruction capabilities of the Belle II detector in charm decays with respect to first generation B-factories using the data collected in 2019 and 2020. Finally, we will show a preliminary result on the measurement of the D0 lifetime, that would be the first at B-Factories, demonstrating the excellent vertexing capabilities of the Belle II detector.

Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. This talk will present recent results in new Belle II data, and future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Early physics goals of the Belle II physics program are to rediscover these rare decays. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already rediscovered with only a small dataset of Belle II and we are aiming to rediscover the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ decays too. Ultimately, the unique setup at Belle II allows to study of modes with missing energies like 𝐵→𝐾∗𝜈𝜈¯. We will discuss about the prospects of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50𝑎𝑏−1 dataset of Belle II.

We utilize this dataset to characterize the performance of the detector about tracking of charged particles, reconstruction of known resonances, and capability of identifying displaced decay vertices. In order to assess the B Physics capabilities of the experiment, one of the first benchmarks to be reached consists in the measurement of the lifetime of B mesons and of the B0-B0bar mixing frequency. We present the first results, based on samples of B mesons that decay to hadronic and semi-leptonic final states.

abstract:The Belle II experiment has recently started operations at the SuperKEKB e+e− collider, located at the KEK laboratory in Tsukuba (Japan). The unprecedented luminosity that it plans to collect in the next decade (50 ab−1) will allow Belle II to greatly exceed the precision achieved by the first generation of B- factory experiments (BaBar and Belle), on the physics of B mesons, charmed particles, τ leptons, and exotic states.After summarizing the challenges and the innovative solutions for accelerator and detector, the physics program of the experiment will be broadly presented, with particular emphasis to the areas on which some intriguing anomalies are now appearing. In many of these cases, the input from Belle II will be crucial to confirm or disprove these hints of physics beyond the standard model.In the last part of the presentation, an overview of the physics results obtained with the early datasets will be given. Among these, some searches for Dark Sector particles are already capable of probing new ground, despite the relatively small integrated luminosity collected so far.

abstract:The tau-lepton lifetime represents a fundamental parameter within the Standard Model framework, contributing to the test of lepton flavor universality. As the present tau lifetime uncertainty is below 0.2%, a competitive measurement is particularly challenging. The method proposed for the Belle II experiment exploits the tiny beam spot size at the interaction point obtained through the new collision scheme of SuperKEKB. By this method, a competitive statistical uncertainty could already be reached with early Belle II data.

abstract:The physics of charmless $B$ decays is an unique portion of the Belle II program. Expected large signals over moderate backgrounds, associated with efficient reconstruction of neutral particles, will enable world-leading determination of the CKM phase $\alpha/\phi_2$, a conclusive understanding of the so-called K-$\pi$ CP puzzle, and further insight into the nature of localized CP violation in three-body decays. We report preliminary measurements based on the sample collected during 2019-2020 operations and corresponding to 63 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. Results include a test of the $K\pi$ isospin sum-rule, and an angular analysis of $B \to \rho^+ \rho^0$ decays.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric $e^+e^-$ collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range. This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

abstract:A search for the flavour-changing neutral current decay B+ → K+ ν ν is performed with an electron-positron collision data sample corresponding to 63fb−1 collected at the Υ(4S) resonance by the Belle II experiment. A novel measurement method is developed, which exploits topological properties of the decay that differ from both generic bottom-meson decays and light-quark pair-production. This inclusive tagging approach has the benefit of a higher signal efficiency compared to previous searches for this rare decay. As no significant signal is observed, an upper limit on the branching fraction of B+ → K+ ν ν of 4.4 × 10−5 is set at the 90% confidence level.

The experiment began operation in 2019 and aims to record a factor of 50 times more data than its predecessor. Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. We present recent results in new Belle II data, and the future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 8×10^{35} cm^{−2}s^{−1} and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab^{−1} of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II. In this presentation, we will review the status of the Belle II detector, the results of the planned measurements with the full available Belle II data set, and the prospects for physics at Belle II.

abstract:The study of lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV) in semitauonic 𝑏-hadron decays has become increasingly important in light of longstanding anomalies in their measured branching fractions, and the very large datasets anticipated from the LHC and Belle II. Belle II is a next-generation SuperB-Factory and successfully started its physics run in 2019. It is expected that Belle II will collect a first sizeable data set in 2021. In this talk, I review the expected sensitivity of semitauonic and other relevant auxiliary measurements to probe LFUV at Belle II. Furthermore, I will discuss how property measurements using full differential information will be obtained in the future in an unbiased way, and how such information can be combined with similar measurements from LHCb and across multiple channels.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is an upgrade of the B factory facility at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. The experiment began operation in 2019 and aims to record a factor of 50 times more data than its predecessor. Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. We present recent results in new Belle II data, and the future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

abstract:sin2𝜙1 (sin2𝛽) is measured using the 𝐶𝑃-eigenstates induced by the 𝑏→𝑐 tree diagram and it is the most precise variable among the CKM angles. We have presented the result of the measurement using the 𝐵0→𝐽/𝜓𝐾0𝑆 decay collected from the early Belle II data. On the other hand, it can be measured also using the decays induced by 𝑏→𝑠 penguin diagram. In that case, contribution of the new physics is expected so that effective sin2𝜙1≡sin2𝜙eff1 is measured. In relation to those measurements, we present the re-discoveries of the 𝐵0→𝐽/𝜓𝐾0𝐿 and 𝐵0→𝜂′𝐾0𝑆 decays using the data set obtained by the Belle II in 2019 and 2020. Former one is a good indicator to check the difference of 𝐶𝑃 eigenvalue between 𝐵0→𝐽/𝜓𝐾0𝑆. Latter one is one of the modes used for sin2𝜙eff1 measurement and its branching fraction is relatively large.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019. Belle II has a broad τ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations (LFV and LNV), benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise τ lepton production in e+e− collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on LF and LN violating τ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of LFV or LNV in τ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying New Physics. In this talk we will review the τ lepton physics program of Belle II.

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles.The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Early physics goals of the Belle II physics program are to rediscover these rare decays. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already rediscovered with only a small dataset of Belle II and we are aiming to rediscover the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ decays too. We will discuss about the prospects of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50𝑎𝑏−1 dataset of Belle II.

This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric e+e− collider, SuperKEKB, aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the next decade, a factor of 50 more than Belle. During the first 1.5 years of operations, around 90 fb−1 of data were collected. This dataset is used to measure the lifetimes of a few charm hadrons, confirming the expected performance of the Belle II detector, in particular the vertexing, which plays a crucial role in time dependent measurements. Thanks to the performance of the detector and the amount of data that we expect to collect, Belle II will play a crucial role in measuring CP violation and D0−D¯0 mixing in many decay channels, especially those having neutral particles in the final state. In this presentation we will also show the sensitivity on mixing and CPV parameters in the golden channel D0→KSπ+π− with a time-dependent Dalitz analysis, and other channels.

abstract:The Belle II experiment has accumulated data corresponding to 89.99 fb-1 integrated luminosity in the past 2 years, and is performing very good. Waiting that the full planned data set will be recorded (50 ab-1), which will allow search for rare processes and will have a tremendous impact in the spectroscopy field, the Phase 3 data set allows to already perform analysis with high precision. We present here the analysis of B -> K J/psi pi pi and B -> K psi(2S): in the former for the first time the evidence for the X(3872) --->Jpsi pi pi has been found at Belle II, which is consistent with the observation at Belle of the same resonant state, performed in 2003. The re-discovery of the X(3872) based on the early Phase3 data includes the efficiency and resolution study, calibration with B -> K psi(2S), and background check. When higher statistics will be available, Belle II is planning the even more interesting analysis of B--->DD*K, and search for X(3872)→DD*.

abstract:Belle II is a B-Factory experiment designed to produce precision measurements of CP violation in the weak sector as well as search for Beyond the Standard Model particle physics. The 𝑒+𝑒− collisions are created by the SuperKEKB accelerator which has achieved a world record of instantaneous luminosity of 2.4×1034cm−2s−1. One of the highest priorities for the early data of the experiment is the search for dark photons that decay to dark matter. A dark photon is a mediator within the dark sector which mixes with the Standard Model (SM) photon. The experimental signature is a single energetic photon observed in the detector. A dark photon would produce an excess of events in the single photon recoil mass. A particularly challenging case is when the visible photon carries the full beam energy, which corresponds to a low-mass dark photon. There is a significant background from the SM process 𝑒+𝑒−→𝛾𝛾, where one of the photons is missed due to detector imperfections. This has motivated us to study the structure of the sub-detectors and compare the data and Monte Carlo response. By understanding the photon detection sensitivity of the sub-detectors, we will estimate the background for dark photon studies. This talk will discuss the ''single photon search'' and the approach to quantifying this background.

abstract:The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is currently the best known description of the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. However, among other things, it cannot explain the existence of dark matter, and some experimental results deviate from SM predicitons, suggesting the possibility of including New Physics by extending the SM. Possible extensions are known as dark sector, and the 𝐿𝜇−𝐿𝜏 model, introducing a 𝑍′ dark boson with 𝑀≈(MeV-GeV), is particularly interesting. In this presentation, the analysis strategy and the preliminary results obtained on Monte Carlo for the search for the visible decay of a 𝑍′ with the Belle II detector in the process 𝑒+𝑒−→𝜇+𝜇−𝑍′, 𝑍′→𝜏+𝜏− will be presented. The Belle II experiment, located at the asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb−1 of data were collected.

abstract:Charmless 𝐵 decays provide a unique portion of the Belle II program. The expected large signal yields with moderate backgrounds associated with efficient reconstruction of neutral particles enable world-leading determination of the CKM phase 𝛼/𝜙2, a conclusive understanding of the so-called K-𝜋 CP puzzle, and further insight into the nature of localized CP violation in three-body decays. We report preliminary measurements based on the sample collected during 2019-2020 operations and corresponding to 65 fb−1 of integrated luminosity. Results include a test of the 𝐾𝜋 isospin sum-rule, an angular analysis of 𝐵→𝜌+𝜌0 decays, and the reconstruction of a 𝐵0→𝜋0𝜋0 signal.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric $e^+e^-$ collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range. This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Early physics goals of the Belle II physics program are to rediscover these rare decays. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already rediscovered with only a small dataset of Belle II and we are aiming to rediscover the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ decays too. We present the first search for 𝐵→𝐾𝜈𝜈¯ at Belle II. We will discuss about the prospects of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50 𝑎𝑏−1 dataset of Belle II.

The Belle II detector benefits from a larger tracking detector and improved tracking and vertexing algorithms with respect to Belle, allowing for improvements in the reconstruction of vertices that are displaced from the interaction point. This talk will review the prospects for long-lived particle searches at Belle II. The experiment can be used to search for long lived particles produced directly in the interaction, or in meson and tau lepton decays.

abstract:Precision determinations of 𝑉𝑢𝑏 and 𝑉𝑐𝑏 play a central role in precision tests of the CKM sector of the Standard Model and complement direct measurements of CP violation of B meson decays. In this talk, we present first studies towards measurements of |𝑉𝑢𝑏| and 𝑉𝑐𝑏, with semileptonic decays using collision events recorded at the Υ(4𝑆) resonance by the Belle II experiment. We report the status of measuring branching fractions and kinematic properties of inclusive and exclusive 𝑏→𝑢ℓ𝜈¯ℓ and 𝑏→𝑐ℓ𝜈¯ℓ decays using untagged and tagged approaches in the full available Belle II data set. In addition, we present a Belle II measurement of the 𝑞2 moments of 𝐵→𝑋𝑐ℓ𝜈 decay. The 𝑞2 moments of the 𝑏→𝑐ℓ𝜈 transition are particularly powerful for constraining the Heavy Quark Expansion as they can be expressed in terms of a reduced set of matrix elements due to reparametrization invariance.

author:Benedikt Wach
abstract:The CKM angle 𝛾 (𝜙3) of the unitarity triangle is the only one that is accessible with tree-level decays in a theoretically clean way. The key method to measure 𝛾 is through the interference between 𝐵+→𝐷0𝐾+ and 𝐵+→𝐷¯0𝐾+ decays that occurs if the final state of the charm-meson decay is accessible to both the 𝐷0 and 𝐷¯0 mesons. The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With the ultimate Belle II data sample of 50 ab−1, a determination of 𝛾 with a precision of 1 degree or better is foreseen. Main operation of SuperKEKB started in March 2019 and results from the full available Belle II data set, which corresponds to approximately 100~fb−1, will be presented. The ratios of decay rates of Γ(𝐵−→𝐷(∗)0𝐾−)/Γ(𝐵−→𝐷(∗)0𝜋−) and Γ(𝐵¯0→𝐷(∗)+𝐾−)/Γ(𝐵¯0→𝐷(∗)+𝜋−) are measured. In addition, more detailed studies of 𝐵−→𝐷(𝐾0S𝜋+𝜋−)𝐾−, 𝐵−→𝐷(𝐾0S𝜋0)𝐾− and 𝐵−→𝐷∗0(𝐷0𝜋0)𝐾− decays are described; these modes are key to the accurate determination of 𝛾 at Belle II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, SuperKEKB, aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the next decade, a factor of 50 more than Belle. During the first 1.5 years of operations, around 90 fb−1 of data were collected. This dataset is used to measure the lifetimes of a few charm hadrons, confirming the expected performance of the Belle II detector, in particular the vertexing, which plays a crucial role in time dependent measurements. Thanks to the performance of the detector and the amount of data that we expect to collect, Belle II will play a crucial role in measuring 𝐶𝑃 violation and 𝐷0−𝐷¯0 mixing in many decay channels, especially those having neutral particles in the final state. In this presentation we will also show the sensitivity on mixing and CPV parameters in the golden channel 𝐷0→𝐾𝑆𝜋+𝜋− with a time-dependent Dalitz analysis, and other channels.

Waiting that the full planned data set will be recorded (50 ab-1), which will allow search for rare processes and will have a tremendous impact in the spectroscopy field, the Phase 3 data set allows to already perform analysis with high precision. We present here the analysis of B -> K J/psi pi pi and B -> K psi(2S): in the former for the first time the evidence for the X(3872) --->Jpsi pi pi has been found at Belle II, which is consistent with the observation at Belle of the same resonant state, performed in 2003.The re-discovery of the X(3872) based on the early Phase3 data includes the efficiency and resolution study, calibration with B -> K psi(2S), and background check. When higher statistics will be available, Belle II is planning the even more interesting analysis of B--->DDK, and search for X(3872)→DD

abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC), i.e. 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ transitions, hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions.A search for the flavor-changing neutral current decay 𝐵+→𝐾+𝜈𝜈¯ is performed with data sample corresponding to 63 𝑓𝑏−1 collected at the Υ(4S) resonance by the Belle II experiment. A novel measurement method is developed, which exploits topological properties of the decay that differ from both generic B-meson decays and light-quark pair-production. This inclusive tagging approach has the benefit of a higher signal efficiency compared to previous searches for this rare decay. As no significant signal is observed, an upper limit on the branching fraction of 𝐵+→𝐾+𝜈𝜈¯ = 4.1×10−5 is set at the 90% confidence level. We will talk about this novel analysis technique and the result.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March2019. Belle II has a broad τ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations (LFV and LNV), benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise τ lepton production in e+e− collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on LF and LN violating τ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of LFV or LNV in τ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying New Physics. In this talk we will review the τ lepton physics program of Belle II.

title:ISR studies at Belle II
author:Sen Jia
abstract:ISR physics is an interesting way to look for resonant states, which - in case of observation - has a clear signature. This is unique to an e+e- experiments. We present here first studies performed with the early Phase 3 data at Belle II. The Belle II experiment has recorded data corresponding to 89.99 fb-1 integrated luminosity, with which we have performed the analysis of the e+e- -> psi(2S), psi(2S)-> pi+ pi- Jpsi, pi0 pi0 Jpsi, and eta Jpsi.

author:Elisabetta Prencipe
abstract:The Belle II experiment has accumulated data corresponding to 89.99 fb-1 integrated luminosity in the past 2 years, and is performing very well. We present here the analysis of B -> K J/psi pi pi and B -> K psi(2S): in the former for the first time the evidence for the X(3872) --->Jpsi pi pi has been found at Belle II, which is consistent with the observation at Belle of the same resonant state.

author:Bianca Savino
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB e+e− collider plans to collect 50 times as much data as the previous generation of experiments. Belle II offers unique capabilities to use the bottomonium system (pairs of bottom/anti-bottom quarks) as a pathway to study new particles and physics beyond the Standard Model. We present the potential for studying exotic multi-quark states, and searching lepton flavor violation and decays to new particles, related to bottomonium at Belle II.

author:Filippo Dattola
abstract:This contribution illustrates a new search for the flavor-changing neutral-current decay B+→K+νν performed by the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider. In this study, a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 63 fb-1 collected at the Υ(4S) resonance and an additional sample of 9 fb-1 collected at an energy 60 MeV below the resonance are used. A novel technique, based on an inclusive tagging method and exploiting the topological features of the B+→K+νν decay, is employed and it provides a higher signal efficiency with respect to the methods used in the previous searches. Future prospects and extensions of the inclusive tagging are also illustrated.

title:Tau physics prospects at Belle II

abstract:The Belle~II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and will operate at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric $e^+e^-$-collider. The design luminosity of the machine is $8~\times~10^{35}~\text{cm}^{2}\text{s}^{-1}$ and the Belle~II experiment aims to record $50~\text{ab}^{-1}$ of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019. Belle II has a broad $\tau$ physics program, in particular in searches for lepton flavour and lepton number violations, benefiting from the large cross section of the pair wise $\tau$ lepton production in $e^+e^-$ -collisions. We expect that after 5 years of data taking, Belle II will be able to reduce the upper limits on lepton flavour and lepton number violating $\tau$ decays by an order of magnitude. Any experimental observation of lepton flavour or lepton number violations in $\tau$ decays constitutes an unambiguous sign of physics beyond the Standard Model, offering the opportunity to probe the underlying new physics. We also present a first measurement of the $\tau$-mass and the prospects for the $\tau$-lifetime measurement. In this talk we will review the $\tau$ lepton physics program of Belle~II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric e+e− collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb−1 of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range. This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

title:Results and Prospects for Radiative and Electroweak Penguin Decays at Belle II
author:Yo Sato
abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of 𝐵-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. These decays are forbidden at tree-level in the SM and can only proceed via suppressed loop level or box diagrams. Rare decays of 𝐵 mesons are an ideal probe to search for phenomena beyond the SM, since contributions from new particles can affect the decays on the same level as SM particles. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. Radiative 𝑏→𝑠𝛾 decays is already been observed and inclusive photon spectra is also obtained with only a small dataset of Belle II. Early measurements related to the electro-weak penguin 𝑏→𝑠ℓℓ and 𝑏→𝑠𝜈𝜈¯ decays has also been performed. We will discuss the results obtained with the current dataset along with the prospects for the searches of these radiative and electroweak penguin decays with the expected 50 𝑎𝑏−1 full dataset of Belle II.

title:Belle II: status and prospects
author:Paolo Branchini
abstract:Belle II at the electron-positron collider SuperKEKB is the successor to the Belle experiment. Its design luminosity is 6 · 1035/(cm2s), 40 times the record achieved at KEKB/Belle, at the same center of mass energy in the bottomonium region. Over the next years it is expected to accumulate an integrated luminosity of 50 ab−1, collecting by far the largest sample of B-mesons at electron-positron colliders, together with large numbers of bottomonium and lighter particles. After a commissioning run in 2018 the detector started routine data taking in March 2019. we have collected more than 200 fb-1 statistics so far. In this talk the current status of the detector, current and future running conditions a selection of the present physics results and further physics prospects will be shown.

title:Dark sector physics at Belle II
author:Giacomo De Pietro
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider, SuperKEKB, is a substantial upgrade of the Belle/KEKB experiment. Belle II aims to record 50 ab−1 of data over the course of the project. During the first physics runs in 2018-2020, around 100 fb−1 of data were collected. These early data include specifically-designed low-multiplicity triggers which allow a variety of searches for light dark matter and dark-sector mediators in the GeV mass range.This talk will present the very first world-leading physics results from Belle II: searches for the invisible decays of a new vector Z’, and visible decays of an axion-like particle; as well as the near-term prospects for other dark-sector searches. Many of these searches are competitive with the data already collected or the data expected in the next few years of operation.

The target luminosity of the machine is 6×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II. In this presentation, we will review the status of the Belle II detector, the results of the planned measurements with the full available Belle II data set, and the prospects for physics at Belle II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector, operating at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider. The design luminosity of the machine is 8 × 10^35 cm−2s−1, and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. From February to July 2018, the machine has completed a commissioning run and the main operation of SuperKEKB has started in March 2019. Belle II has a broad tau physics program, from high-precision measurements of SM parameters to searches of new physics via experimental observation of BSM processes, such as lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation or lepton flavor violation (LFV) decays. In this talk we review the status of the Belle II experiment, and the prospects for the measurement of the tau lepton mass and lifetime, fundamental inputs in tests of LFU violation.

author:Chaoyi Lyu
abstract:Semileptonic B decays allow measurements of the magnitudes of the CKM matrix elements V_cb and V_ub, thus providing access to fundamental parameters of the theory. Thanks to the low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event, Belle II is expected to greatly improve the precision on these parameters, using both inclusive and exclusive techniques. The latest results and prospects will be presented. In addition, measurements of the CKM unitarity triangle angles, which parameterize CP violation in the standard model, will be discussed.

title:Quarkonium at Belle II
author:Junhao Yin
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider is an upgrade of the B factory facility at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan. The experiment began operation in 2019 and aims to record a factor of 50 times more data than its predecessor. Belle II is uniquely capable of studying the so-called "XYZ" particles: heavy exotic hadrons consisting of more than three quarks. First discovered by Belle, these now number in the dozens, and represent the emergence of a new category within quantum chromodynamics. We present recent results in new Belle II data, and the future prospects to explore both exotic and conventional quarkonium physics.

author:Kojima Kazuki
abstract:In the recent years, several measurements of B-decays with flavor changing neutral currents, i.e. 𝑏→𝑠 transitions hint at deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. In addition there are discrepancies with the SM predictions in 𝑏→𝑐𝜏𝜈 decays. The Belle II experiment is a substantial upgrade of the Belle detector and operates at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric 𝑒+𝑒− collider. The present status of measurements at Belle II related to these so called B anomalies will be presented, including a novel search for the 𝐵→𝐾𝜈𝜈¯, 𝑏→𝑠 transition.

title:The Belle II: status and prospects
author:Eiasha Waheed
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The target luminosity of the machine is 6×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II. In this presentation, we will review the status of the Belle II detector, the results of the planned measurements with the full available Belle II data set, and the prospects for physics at Belle II.

abstract:The Belle II experiment is in the unique position of probing a yet uncharted sector of particle physics, which includes hypothetical particles coupling very weekly with the standard model ones that might help explaining the nature of dark matter and other anomalies. Belle II analyzed 0.5 fb-1 of commissioning data to exclude part of the parameter space of models including low mass Z` bosons and axion-like particles. The results of a new search for Dark-Higgstrahlung processes, obtained on the 2019 data set, are presented and longer-term reach on a variety of Dark Sector signatures are also discussed.

author:Zuzana Gruberova
abstract:The low-background environment of electron-positron collisions along with the large expected sample size and an hermetic detector make Belle II the premier experiment for studying tau-lepton physics. A competitive measurement of the mass of the tau lepton is reported based on a a small data set, and studies for world-leading measurements of tau lifetimes, foreseen with significantly less data than collected at Belle and Babar, are discussed. Perspectives on tests of lepton (flavor) universality and other searches for non-SM physics in tau decays are also outlined.

title:Prospects of the new physics search at Belle II by precise measurements of the CKM matrix elements
author:Yun-Tsung Lai
abstract:In Standard Model, CKM matrix describes the quark coupling strength with weak interaction, as the determination on the elements is always an important field in flavor physics. Deviation from the unitarity of the matrix can be an indication to physics beyond the Standard Model. Measurements on various B decay mechanisms provide experimental constraints on each of the matrix elements, as some of them are unique to B factories. Belle II experiment at SuperKEKB has started beam collision since 2018. It is designed to reach an expected instantaneous luminosity of 6*10^35 cm^-2s^-1 and a integrated luminosity of ~50 ab^-1. Measurement in Belle II benefits not only from the larger amount of data but also the better performance in both detectors and software packages. e.g. tracking, vertexing, PID, reconstruction, etc, as they will improve the determination on CKM matrix elements in various aspects. This talk will review on status of measurements associated to each element, the possible improvement on the sensitivity and the prospect in Belle II.

title:Prospects of |Vub| measurement at Belle II
author:Tommy Martinov
abstract:Belle II is a B-factory experiment and thus offers a perfect environment for measuring the CKM-matrix element |Vub|. This measurement is particularly important for a precise test of the unitarity condition. Two types of measurement exist to extract |Vub|, both relying on semi-leptonic decays of B mesons: the exclusive measurements (where a particular u-hadron is reconstructed) and the inclusive measurements (they effectively sum over all possible hadronic final states containing a u-quark). The two methods show a long-standing discrepancy of 3sigma. I will present in this talk the first studies of |Vub| performed at Belle II and I will outline what the prospects are for this measurement.

With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with 𝐵 and charmed mesons, and 𝜏 leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. We also expect exciting results in quarkonium physics with Belle II.

abstract:The investigation of B-meson decays to charmed and charmless hadronic final states is a keystone of the Belle II physics program. It allows for theoretically reliable and experimentally precise constraints on the CKM Unitarity Triangle fit, and is sensitive to effects from non-SM physics. Results on branching ratios, direct CP-violating asymmetries, and polarization of various charmless B decays are presented, with particular emphasis on those for which Belle II will have unique sensitivity. Perspectives on the precision achievable on the CKM angles and on the so called 'Kπ puzzle' are also discussed.New results from combined analyses of Belle and Belle II data to determine the CKM angle ϕ3 (or γ) and time-dependent CP violation measurements are also presented.

author:Christoph Schwanda
abstract:The rate of semitauonic B decays has been consistently above theory expectations since these decays were first measured. Recently significant differences between the forward-backward asymmetry in B -> Denu and B -> Dmunu were also reported. Belle II data are well suited to probe these anomalies. The low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event offer high precision. This talk presents recent Belle II results on lepton flavor universality tests based on B->D(*)ell nu decays. We also discuss anomalies in hadronic B decay such as the 𝐾𝜋 puzzle and the 𝑏→𝐷(∗)ℎ branching fractions.

title:Recent Belle II results on semitauonic decays and tests of lepton-flavor universality
author:Henrik Junkerkalefeld
abstract:The rate of semitauonic 𝐵 decays has been consistently above theory expectations since these decays were first measured. Recently significant differences between the forward-backward asymmetry in 𝐵→𝐷∗𝑒𝜈 and 𝐵→𝐷∗𝜇𝜈 were also reported. Belle II data is well suited to probe such anomalies. The low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event offer high precision measurements of semileptonic 𝐵 decays. This talk presents recent Belle II results on lepton flavor universality tests based on inclusive decays.

abstract:The investigation of 𝐵-meson decays to charmed and charmless hadronic final states is a keystone of the Belle II physics program. It allows for theoretically reliable and experimentally precise constraints on the CKM Unitarity Triangle fit, and is sensitive to effects from non-SM physics. Results on branching ratios, direct CP-violating asymmetries, and polarization of various charmless B decays are presented, with particular emphasis on those for which Belle II will have unique sensitivity. New results from combined analyses of Belle and Belle II data to determine the CKM angle 𝜙3 (or 𝛾) are also presented.

abstract:Measurements of decay-time dependent CP violation are chief goals of the Belle II physics program. Comparison between penguin-dominated 𝑏→𝑞𝑞¯𝑠 and tree-dominated 𝑏→𝑐𝑐¯𝑠 results allows for stringent tests of CKM unitarity that are sensitive to non-SM physics. This talk present first Belle II results on the mixing rate and lifetime of 𝐵0 mesons, an essential validation of time-dependent measurements that requires detailed control of complex high-level capabilities such as flavor tagging and decay-time resolution modeling.

The design luminosity of the machine is 6×10^35 cm-2s-1 and the Belle II experiment aims to ultimately record 50 ab-1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons.

Belle II has already accumulated about 400/fb of dataset, as well as the Y(10750) scan data at four energy points with the luminosity of 19.22/fb. With these datasets, Belle and Belle II would be able to search for new states on charmonium, bottomonium, and baryons spectroscopies, and measure their properties. In this presentation, we will review the latest spectroscopy results from Belle and Belle II.

title:Recent results from Belle II
author:Karol Mateusz Adamczyk
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+e− collider is a substantial upgrade of the B factory facility at the Japanese KEK laboratory. The design luminosity of the machine is 6×1035 cm−2s−1 and the Belle II experiment aims to ultimately record 50 ab−1 of data, a factor of 50 more than its predecessor. With this data set, Belle II will be able to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, the matrix elements and their phases, with unprecedented precision and explore flavor physics with B and charmed mesons, and τ leptons. Belle II has also a unique capability to search for low mass dark matter and low mass mediators. In this presentation, we will review the latest results from Belle II, with emphasis on those related to lepton flavour violation.

title:Time-dependent CP violation measurements at Belle II
author:Ming-Chuan Chang
abstract:Measurements of decay-time dependent CP violation are chief goals of the Belle II physics program. Comparison between penguin-dominated b→qq ̅s and tree-dominated b→cc ̅s results allows for stringent tests of CKM unitarity that are sensitive to non-SM physics. This talk present first Belle II results on the mixing rate and lifetime of B^0 mesons, an essential validation of time-dependent measurements that requires detailed control of complex high-level capabilities such as flavor tagging and decay-time resolution modeling. Recent results on B^0→K_S^0 π^0 γ and B^0→K_S^0 K_S^0 K_S^0 are also reported.

title:Search fro a stable double strange hexaquark at Belle II
author:Bianca Scavino
abstract:QCD-motivated models for hadrons predict a wide variety of multi-quark states beyond ordinary mesons and baryons, known as exotic states. The first observation of a heavy exotic state by Belle in 2003 has triggered a huge experimental effort, and the last 20 years have marked a turning point in the field. To date, states composed of four and five valence quark have been observed and their existence confirmed. The possible observation of six-quark states would give us further insight into understanding and describing the strong interaction. In particular, the search for a stable double strange hexaquark, which was put forward also as a dark matter candidate, is part of the Belle II physics program, and a fraction of the experiment data taking period is plan to be dedicated to run at the energy of the Υ(3𝑆) resonance, particularly well suited for searches for multiquark states with non-zero strangeness. This talk presents a feasibility study for the search for a stable double strange six-quark state 𝑆 produced in Υ(3𝑆) decays, with a focus on the obtained predictions for both existing and novel measurements.

author:Priyanka Cheema
abstract:Semileptonic decays of B mesons that proceed via b->c and b->u transitions, as well as rare leptonic B decays, are fertile grounds for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. The Belle II experiment presents as an excellent opportunity to study such decays, and since beginning operation in 2019, Belle II has already recorded half of the data collected by its predecessor, and reached a world record instantaneous luminosity greater than 4x10^34 /cm^2s. Belle II expects to explore flavour physics with B and charmed mesons with unprecedented precision, and has already produced multiple world-leading results in this area. We present recent results from Belle II that are focused on semileptonic and leptonic B decays, and discuss prospects of current studies into lepton flavour violating B decays that are highly sensitive to new physics.

title:CKM matrix measurements (focus on Vxb)
author:Marcus Prim
abstract:In this presentation, I will provide an overview on the current knowledge on the unitarity of the CKM matrix and its constraining power on new physics contributions. I will further review the current knowledge on the determination of Vub and Vcb, whose values constrain together with the CKM angle γ/ϕ3 constrain the apex of the unitary triangle. Several new measurements emerged recently that provide more insights on the tensions between different determination methods.

title:Recent Belle II results related to lepton-flavor universality and violation
author:Marco Milesi
abstract:The rate of semitauonic $B$ decays has been consistently above theory expectations since these decays were first measured. Also, there are various anomalies in flavour-changing neutral current decays $b->sll$. The low-background collision environment along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two $B$ mesons in the event offer high precision measurements of semileptonic $B$ decays. This talk presents recent Belle II results related to lepton flavor universality tests based on $B$ decays. In addition, a search for the lepton number violating decay in tau decay is presented.

author:Michael De Nuccio
abstract:Axions and Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that could help solve the strong QCD problem and/or act as dark matter or dark portals. B factories are high-precision experiments specialized in B physics, but also exceptionally capable of probing the dark matter MeV-to-GeV range. In this talk, I will report on the status and the recent results of searches for axions and ALPs at the past B factories, BaBar and Belle, and the current, second-generation Belle II.

title:BSM CP violation searches at Belle II
author:Radek Zlebcik
abstract:Up to now, the Belle II experiment has collected about the same amount of data as BaBar and the plan is to collect 50 times more. New physics can affect the phase of the amplitudes and consequently the measured CP violation parameters. There are two main complementary approaches: overconstraining the SM parameters in the precision measurements of the high-statistics tree-level B decays or searching for the deviations in the rare B decays where BSM effects are expected to be more pronounced. Compared to the hadron-hadron experiments, Belle II benefits from clean event topology which is essential for B decays including neutral particles.

The analysis uses hadronic reconstruction of the tag-side $B$ meson based on Full Event Interpretation technique and purely leptonic $\tau$ decays on signal-side $B$ meson. We will report the methodology and expected sensitivity, as well as part of the expected systematic uncertainty.

title:Bottomonium physics at Belle II
author:Alessandro Boschetti
abstract:Bottomonium spectroscopy offers excellent opportunities for insights on the behavior of QCD in the non-perturbative regime. In order to guide theorists through the difficult task of modeling non-perturbative QCD phenomena, the experimental measurement of masses, widths, and transition rates of bb¯ states is crucial. Recent analyses of Belle and Belle II data samples unveiled unexpected results in this field, such as the observation of anomalous transition rates and of new states that challenge the conventional description of bb¯ mesons. In particular, the newly observed state identified as Y(10753) is generating a big interest among theorists concerning its interpretation. The bb¯ spectroscopy is thus encouraging the birth of a variety of new theoretical models. The latter include the contribution of hadronic loops, or the existence of exotic states such as compact tetraquarks, hadrobottomonia and hybrids. Belle II has the unique opportunity to analyze the 19 fb−1 data sample collected with a scan near √s=10.75 GeV, in order to provide experimental results in this sector. The talk will thus be focused on the recent Belle II results with the scan data and related prospects.

title:Muons, taus and other results from Belle (II) and J-PARC experiments
author:MyeongJae Lee
abstract:Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) refers to a violation of the "accidental" conservation of particle flavor, which is considered an unambiguous signature of new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The Belle experiment has extensively studied CLFV decays of the tau lepton. Currently, the COMET experiment is under construction to study muon CLFV, with Phase-I data taking scheduled for 2024. This talk will focus on recent progress and results from these two experiments related to CLFV. Additionally, the status of a new experiment on the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) measurement at J-PARC will be briefly discussed.

title:Flavor physics with Belle and Belle II
author:Takeo Higuchi
abstract:Belle II is a high-energy physics experiment searching for new physics in a large number of B meson, D meson, and tau lepton decays produced in electron-positron collisions at the SuperKEKB accelerator at KEK laboratory in Japan. Belle II has reported a handful of world-leading or competitive results to date. Examples of the results include the lepton universality tests, the search for the new CP-violating phase and the long-lived particles, and the tau leptons mass. We will report on the latest new-physics search results at Belle II. Belle II operation is currently suspended to upgrade the vertex detector and PID detector. At the symposium, we will also review the status of the upgrade activities and discuss the positive impact of the upgrade on physics output. Relevant results from still lasting the predecessor Belle activities will also be mentioned.

title:Recent Belle II results on hadronic B decays
author:Shu-Ping Lin
abstract:The investigation of B-meson decays to charmed and charmless hadronic final states is a keystone of the Belle II program. Analyses of such decays provide reliable and experimentally precise constraints on the CKM Unitarity Triangle fit, are sensitive to effects from non-SM physics, and further knowledge about uncharted b->c hadronic transitions. We present recent results on branching ratios and direct CP-violating asymmetries of several B decays, which result in a competitive SM test based on the Kpi isospin sum rule and first observations of three new B->D(*)KKS decays. We also present new results from combined analyses of Belle and Belle II data to determine the CKM angle phi3 (or gamma).

author:Jakub Kandra
abstract:Measurements of time dependent CP violation are chief goals of the Belle II physics program. Comparisons of penguin-dominated b-> qqbar s to tree-dominated b-> ccbar s results allow for stringent tests of CKM unitarity that are sensitive to non-SM physics, but require excellent vertexing capabilities. After presenting recent world-leading results on charm-hadron lifetimes that demonstrate the Belle II vertexing performance, we report on results on B0->Kspi0, B0->KsKsKs, and B0->phiKs decays. In addition, a novel algorithm to identify the flavor of neutral charm mesons is presented that effectively doubles the sample size for many measurements of CP violation and flavor mixing.

In addition, the low-background environment of electron-positron collisions along with the large expected sample size and an hermetic detector make Belle II the premier experiment for studying tau-lepton physics. This talk presents recent world-leading physics results from Belle II searches for dark Z’ decays; as well as for long-lived (pseudo) scalars in B decays. Results from Belle II determinations of the tau lepton mass and from searches for tau decays into a scalar non-SM particle and a lepton are also presented.

title:Recent Belle II results on semileptonic B decays and LFU tests
author:Tak Shun Lau   
abstract:Semileptonic B decays allow to determine the magnitudes of the CKM matrix parameters |V_cb| and |V_ub|, two fundamental parameters of the SM flavor sector. In addition, the observed rate of semitauonic B decays has been consistently above expectations since these decays were first measured. At Belle II these measurements use both exclusive decays such as B -> D*lnu and B -> pilnu, and inclusive X_clnu or X_ulnu final states restricted in phase space. The low-background collision environment at Belle II, along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event, offer high precision. Recent results on |V_cb| and |V_ub| are presented along with recent Belle II results on lepton flavor universality tests.

title:Recent results from the Belle II experiment
author:Chengping Shen
abstract:The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider has been collecting the world’s highest-intensity collisions at the Υ(4S) since 2019. A data set comparable in size to that of predecessor experiments, and collected with the new detector, enables unique or world-leading results. Examples include indirect searches for non-standard-model physics in the weak interactions of quarks, determinations of fundamental standard-model parameters, and direct searches for low-mass dark matter. This talk presents a selection of recent results and briefly discusses future perspectives.

title:Status of flavor anomalies with Belle & Belle II
author:Youngjoon Kwon
abstract:Recently there have been much interest with the so-called B-physics anomalies or tensions from B-factory experiments, including Belle, Belle II, BaBar, and LHCb experiments. Some of them are related with the lepton flavor universality, while there are other tensions e.g. in the CKM matrix element $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$. Also, in the past, there was a tension in the direct CP asymmetry in $B \to K \pi$ decays. In this talk, we review the current experimental status of such anomalies and related subjects in $B$ decays from the existing measurements, and present the prospects.

title:Recent results on B semileptonic decays from Belle and Belle II
author:Youngjoon Kwon
abstract:Precise determination of the magnitudes and phases of the elements, in particular, Vcb and Vub, of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is crucial for testing the unitarity of the CKM matrix, hence testing the Standard Model. The magnitudes of these elements are best measured by using B-meson semileptonic decays. Moreover, semileptonic B-meson decays provide a great testing ground for lepton universality of charged-current weak interaction processes. In this talk, we report recent unique and/or competitive results of inclusive and exclusive B-meson semileptonic decays, which have been measured by analyzing high-statistics data sample of BBbar pairs from the Belle and Belle II experiments. Some of these analyses utilize tag-side reconstruction of a companion B-meson decaying into hadronic final states, providing direct access to the signal B rest-frame and the relevant decay characteristics. The subjects we present in this talk are all relevant for either testing lepton universality or precision measurement of the CKM elements |Vcb| and |Vub|.

abstract:Charm physics, involving a heavy up-type quark, offers a pathway to search for new particles and couplings beyond the Standard Model complementary to that of B physics. A program based on precision measurements of charm lifetimes is now underway at Belle II, and benefits from the detector`s outstanding vertexing performance and low-background environment. Recent results from measurements of Ds meson and Omega_c baryon lifetimes are presented.

author:Marko Staric
abstract:Charm physics, involving a heavy up-type quark, offers a pathway to search for new particles and couplings beyond the Standard Model complementary to that of B physics. Measurements of CP violation and mixing play a key role in this program. We present a novel algorithm that identifies the flavor of neutral charm mesons at the time of production. This algorithm effectively doubles the sample size for many measurements of CP violation and flavor mixing at Belle II, which in the past have relied on charm mesons originating from D* decays.

abstract:Time-dependent measurements of CP violation are chief goals of the Belle II physics program. Comparison between penguin-dominated b ->qqbars and tree-dominated b -> ccbars results allows for stringent tests of CKM unitarity that are sensitive to non-SM physics. This program requires excellent vertexing capabilities. After presenting recent world-leading results on charm-hadron lifetimes that demonstrate the Belle II vertexing performance, we report on recent results on B0->Ks,pi0; B0->Ks,Ks,Ks; and B0->phi,Ks decays. In addition, a novel algorithm to identify the flavor of neutral charm mesons is presented that effectively doubles the sample size for many measurements of CP violation and flavor mixing.

author:Kazuki Kojima
abstract:Semileptonic B-meson decays allow for determining the magnitudes of the CKM matrix parameters Vcb and Vub, two fundamental parameters of the SM flavor sector and to probe the excess rate of semitauonic B decays, which has been consistently above expectations in recent years. Belle II analyses use both exclusive decays such as B->D*,l,nu and B->pi,l,nu, or inclusive Xc,l,nu or Xu,l,nu final states restricted in phase space. The low-background collision environment, along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two mesons in the event, offer precisions on Vub and Vcb approaching that of world-best results and provides unique probes of lepton-flavor universality violation.

Thus, the observation of CLFV would be a clear signature of new physics. We report the world-leading result of lepton-flavor-violating decays of \tau lepton decays into a light charged lepton (l = e,mu) and a vector meson using the full data sample collected by the Belle. In addition, we report the searches for new physics in tau decays, especially with its decay involving heavy neutral lepton. We also cover recent searches for tau decays into a scalar non-standard-model particle and a light charged lepton. The results are based on the data set collected by the Belle experiment at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider.

title:Recent Belle II results on the CKM parameters |V_cb| and |V_ub|
author:Racha Cheaib
abstract:Semileptonic B-meson decays allow for determining the magnitudes of the CKM matrix parameters Vcb and Vub, two fundamental parameters of the SM flavor sector. Belle II analyses use both exclusive decays such asB->D*lnu and B->pilnu, or inclusive X_clnu or X_ulnu final states restricted in phase space. The low-background collision environment, along with the possibility of partially or fully reconstructing one of the two B mesons in the event, offer precision on Vcb and Vub approaching that of world-best results.

title:Recent Belle II results in charm physics
author:Angelo Di Canto
abstract:Charm physics, involving a heavy up-type quark, offers a pathway to search for new particles and couplings beyond the Standard Model complementary to that of B physics. A program based on precision measurements of charm lifetimes is now underway at Belle II, and benefits from the detector`s outstanding vertexing performance and low-background environment. Recent results from measurements of D_s meson and Omega_c baryon lifetimes are presented. In addition, a novel algorithm to identify the flavor of neutral charm mesons is presented that effectively doubles the sample size for many measurements of CP violation and flavor mixing.

abstract:Rare decays of B mesons to radiative final states serve as an ideal ground to search for New Physics effects from short range contributions. Being one of the first transitions of the electroweak penguin family to be observed by CLEO in the early 90s, these transitions serve an important role in testing the predictions of the Standard Model. In this talk we summarize the latest results coming from Belle and Belle II for the radiative penguin transitions.

title:A model-independent likelihood function for the Belle II B+ -> K+νν analysis
author:Lorenz Ennio Gaertner
abstract:Rare decays like  B+ -> K+νν, searched for by the Belle II collaboration, are important in particle physics research as they offer a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the experimental challenges induced by the two final state neutrinos require assumptions on the kinematic distribution of this decay. Consequently, the results feature a model dependency arising from both Standard Model assumptions and from the description of the pertinent hadronic matrix element, making reinterpretation complicated without reanalysing the underlying data. In this work, we address this issue by deriving a model-independent likelihood function, parameterizing the theory space in terms of Wilson coefficients of the weak effective theory, and reweighting the signal template according to the predicted kinematic signal distribution. By extending the pyhf fitting software and interfacing it with the EOS software for flavor physics phenomenology, we can perform a runtime update of the theoretical model, enabling us to derive exclusion limits in the space of Wilson coefficients. Once public, the model-independent likelihood function will be a useful tool for the particle physics community to perform tests on existing theoretical models.

title:Analysis of the rare B+ -> K+ nu nubar decay at Belle II
author:Roberta Volpe
abstract:We search for the rare decay B+ -> K+ nu nubar in a 362 /fb sample of electron-positron collisions at the Upsilon(4S) resonance collected with the Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB collider.  The branching fraction is predicted with high accuracy in the standard model (SM) and is enhanced in several SM extensions.  We use the inclusive properties of the other \B meson in the Upsilon(4S) -> B Bbar events to suppress background from other B-meson decays and light-quark pair production. In addition, we validate the measurement with an auxiliary analysis based on a conventional hadronic reconstruction of the accompanying B meson. The signal-reconstruction efficiency and background suppression are validated using control channels. The branching fraction is extracted in a maximum likelihood fit. Our inclusive and hadronic analyses obtain consistent results. The accuracy is significantly improved compared to the previous Belle II analysis.  The results are combined and compared to the background-only hypothesis and to the SM expectations.
